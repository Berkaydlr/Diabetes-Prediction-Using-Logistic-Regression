# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
Machine learning project utilizing logistic regression to predict diabetes among Pima Indian women based on health metrics. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and validation with both holdout and 10-fold cross-validationÂ techniques

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether individuals have diabetes based on certain features. The dataset used in this study is part of a larger dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the USA. It focuses on a study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above residing in Phoenix, Arizona, the fifth-largest city in the USA. The dataset comprises 768 observations and 8 numerical independent variables. The target variable, "Outcome," indicates whether a diabetes test result is positive (1) or negative (0).
